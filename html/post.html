            <p id="paraStyling">  To say that Jimi Hendrix life revolved around music would not be an overstatement. Becoming an entirely different person on stage, the eccentrically dressed guitar wizard was shy and quiet as soon as the guitar was not dangling round his neck (or behind it) doing the talking for him, his words became scarce. But oh, could the guitar talk. I think the best example is the performance of The Star Spangled Banner opening his Woodstock performance.Going on after heavy rains shook the epic music festival, Jimi did not need to set his guitar on fire to set it on fire. His rendition of the US national anthem is haunting to this day. Amidst the raging Vietnam war and the Civil Rights Movement, Hendrix spoke without words, his guitar taking on a life of its own bending and shredding the strings with such heavy reverb and electronic distortion that they sounded somewhat close to exploding bombs. Especially against the political and historical backdrop this really goes underneath the skin. Jimi Hendrix managed to express himself and the times he lived in, through his guitar. In the time of political and social upheaval, musicians like that are not just mind stirring but soul healing and his distorted and violent version of the national anthem seems to be as fitting for this moment in time as ever, looking at the current affairs shaking the United States.Music was Jimi Hendrix’ way of talking, of expressing himself, of looking at the moment in time and society. His lyrics tell personal stories of love and heartbreak, of his childhood and struggles, but they also tell the story of the times Hendrix lived in. Deeply rooted in the blues tradition, they express pain suffered by an entire people treated unjustly. Over the span of four years – his short recording career – Hendrix managed to shape and change the understanding of music and the role of the electric guitar in rock and pop music. Throughout his journey to the top, he remained his authentic self while the industry pushed and tugged to make him fit into their narrow-minded boxes. When I think about authenticity in music and artistic expression, I think Jimi Hendrix. He pioneered the use of electronic elements in music, of amps, distortion, and pedals in a way nobody dared to at that time and I am convinced that much of today’s musical versatility is owed to that unique and courageous exploration of creativity.</p>
